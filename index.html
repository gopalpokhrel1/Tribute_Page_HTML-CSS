                Amar Singh Thapa is one of the great heroes of the country. While talking about Amar Singh Thapa
                Biography, Amar Singh Thapa is the son of Umarau Bhim Singh Thapa. His father had got the title Bhag
                Bhim Singh. He was born at Sirhanchok in Gorkha in 1761. He is such a national hero of Nepal who spent
                all his active life fighting for his country Nepal. <br>

                He never fought for having a desire for money or wealth and not for any type of comfort or luxury. If we
                read the history of Nepal, we easily know that he fought solely to extend the territory of Nepal. Amar
                Singh Thapa played a very very important historical role in all the battles from the Gorkha side during
                the rule of Bahadur Shah, the younger son of King Prithvi Narayan Shah.
                <br>Amar Singh Thapa was put under military training at the young age of 8 years. He was brave and
                skillful in the art of war. It is because of his bravery that the border of Nepal reached Sutlez and
                Gadwal.
                <br>

                Amar Singh Thapa, who displayed unprecedented valor on the western front during the unification wars,
                was even praised by the British in glowing terms During the Anglo-Nepal War of 1814, Amar Singh Thapa
                sustained the Fort of Malaun for over six months with a meager 200 soldiers under him. Even in the most
                adverse situation, he never contemplated surrendering before the British.
